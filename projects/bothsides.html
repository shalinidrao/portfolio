      <h4>Opportunity Framing</h4>
      <p>Opportunity framing came relatively easily since it was just building off of Napol’s 
        pitch of the original idea. He had built a lot of the necessary analysis models already; 
        it was really only a matter of initial tweaks to make sure we all agreed with the problem 
        space we wanted to attack. We added some new research (four brains is better than one) to 
        really flesh out the analysis models. At this point, we didn’t really decide on an actual 
        implementation of the service, only what it would actually do. It was still quite an 
        abstract idea of the benefit we wanted to give users. 
        <br><br>
        We looked more into the competitors and the PESTLE analysis to come up with  a final 
        discussion of what we wanted the problem focus to be. 
        <br><br>
        As for feedback, we got the first of what would be many occurrences of the same criticism 
        that  we needed to push the actual harms of the “Filter Bubble” problem is if we wanted to 
        make it our main motivator for why any user should adopt our service. We focused too much 
        on the features in our competing services instead of how it actually plays into the scenario 
        we were focused on. This helped us in our future MVP pitch directions for how to frame our 
        service as a solution to problems in everyday life. </p>

      <h4>Final Pitch</h4>
      <p>With our final pivot made, we only had to tweak our value model to show that our value 
        would be targeting both students and institutions, to reflect the new customer-user 
        distinction that came with our revenue model shift. We received positive feedback when 
        presenting this change to the class, with a few questions about how to roll out an MVP 
        in this way to show the school that the service was viable. Luckily, some of our interviews 
        were with CMU officials who would be directly involved in the establishment of such a deal 
        between BothSides and an educational institution. The main requirement for such a partnership 
        would be concrete evidence of actual benefits the service could bring to the student body. 
        <br><br>
        With our main principles locked down, we went into our Pitch Video with a heavier focus on 
        highlighting problems in daily life that act as current barriers to understanding multiple 
        perspectives of the news. We created animations to help depict a more dymamic representation 
        of these problems and cut down all our research into bite-size chunks that would be snappy and 
        stick with our audience. 
        <br><br>
        We went into the investor showcase excited to answer more questions from our guests. We received 
        multiple positive comments about the timeliness of our service as well as several critical questions 
        about the feasibility of rolling out our service on a large scale. We were very pleased to place 
        4th in both the investor and student categories. We all agreed that should the opportunity come up, 
        we would all be interested in the actual development and deployment of BothSides. We would aim to 
        first get our service to be used in specific civics and poltiical science courses where they would 
        have the most initial obvious value in an academic setting. 
        <br><br>
        We thoroughly enjoyed working on BothSides and learned so much throughout this class and project. </p>
