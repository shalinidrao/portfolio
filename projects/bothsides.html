      <h5>Teammates: Brady Baldwin, Cheuk Yin (Phipson) Lee, Pei-Yu (Alex) Tsai</h5> 
      <h6>We were tasked with performing multiple user research methods to help a local
        Pittsburgh theatre stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.</h6>

      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Like most other performing arts centers, Kelly Strayhorn Theater had to make 
        an abrupt transition to online programming with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        Since most of their events and audience donations relied on in-person interactions, 
        they needed to find a new way to garner the same interest and attendance virtually, 
        while still compelling audience members to donate some amount for their experience. 
        The shift to strictly online programming has made it more difficult to hold as many of 
        their normal events and workshops that KST visitors often expected and had come to love. 
        Their “pay-what-makes-you-happy” philosophy does not as easily transfer into an online 
        content format. </p>
      
      <h4>Methods</h4>
      <p>Our initial research was done by asking 4 participants to go through a think-aloud 
        interview and go through the Oregon Shakespeare Festival website, which has similar 
        goals to those of KST. We synthesized this information to evaluate the problems and 
        positive elements our users noticed on their website. </p>
      <p>We then went on to conduct contextual inquiries with both viewers and content creators 
        to evaluate their donation and promotion habits where applicable. We wanted to understand 
        why a viewer would choose to go the extra mile to donate their own money to a creator and 
        how a creator would balance creating their own content with making sure their donors were 
        still happy. We found that users only wanted to donate if they were getting some kind of 
        tangible benefit and if they deemed the creator worthy of their support. We plotted all 
        these observations using affinity diagramming to look at everything in a big picture and 
        create groups of common themes we found. </p>
      <p>With our storyboards developed, we went on to do speed dating sessions with adults with 
        theater/performing experience to get thri perspectives on the solutions we had come up with. 
        They all confirmed our previous hypothesis that educational content is a great perk and social 
        interaction is a good motivator to get any user to buy into a new membership. We came up with 
        some key insights from all our research at this point that would fuel the rest of the development 
        of our solution:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users want a tangible benefit from their monetary contribution</li>
        <li>Users have more intrinsic motivation to support a creator if they feel 
          the creator actually deserves it</li>
        <li>Educational content is a great motivator for futher support</li>
        <li>Donors want to be well informed about what their money is getting them</li>
        <li>Digital content is enjoyable and less pressure </li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top:1em;">From here, we developed our prototype for a membership hub to be hosted on KST’s website, 
        with a new button on the homepage to compel users to navigate to the membership page. We 
        wanted to make the perks clear and concise to compel more users  to buy into the community. 
        We created a community hub for members to converse with one another, as well as multiple feeds 
        for exclusive events and workshops members could attend. We did a testing session with our 
        experience prototype and found that our participants found the live chat option to be distracting 
        an unnecessary. So, we opted to change the element to navigate to a third party application where 
        community members could converse with one another. </p>

      <h4>Final Reflection</h4>
      <p>This was my first client-based project and it was extermely rewarding to go 
        through the entire user research process, especially with my team to support me. 
        We aimed to help KST with their community involvement and donor acquisition. Our 
        solution only enhances their community-driven mission to bring artists together 
        and compel audience members to engage further with the theater and its content. 
        Especially being able use the methods from this class in other projects, I truly 
        learned the value of a detailed and diligent research process to inform your final 
        solution. </p>
